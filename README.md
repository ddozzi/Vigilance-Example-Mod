# Vigilance Example Mod (Java)
I really seen any mods that use [Vigilance](https://github.com/Sk1erLLC/Vigilance) and Essential with Java, so here's a quick example mod I made.

## Usage
If you're planning on using this in a development environment, don't forget to add
```
--tweakClass gg.essential.loader.stage0.EssentialSetupTweaker
```
to the JVM arguments or it won't work
